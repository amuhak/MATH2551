$f (a, b)$ is a **local maximum** value of $f$ if $f (a, b) \geq f(x,y)$ for all domain points $(x, y)$ in an open disk centered at $(a, b)$.
$f (a, b)$ is a **local minimum** value of $f$ if $f (a, b) \leq f(x,y)$ for all domain points $(x, y)$ in an open disk centered at $(a, b)$.

## First Derivative Test
If $f (x, y)$ has a local maximum or local minimum value at an interior point $(a, b)$ of its domain and if the first partial derivatives exist there, then $f_x(a, b) = 0$ and $f_y(a, b) = 0$

## Saddle points
This is a point where its is a local maximum in one direction and local minimum in another.
