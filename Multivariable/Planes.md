The plane through the point $P_0$ normal to $\vec{n} = Ai+Bj+Ck$ is given by the vector equation,
$$
\vec{n} \cdot \vec{P_0P}=0
$$
and the component equations,
$$
A(x-x_0)+B(y-y_0)+C(z-z_0)=0
$$

Given a line $L$ and a point $P$ in a plain you can find the equation of the plane, 
Take a point $Q$ on the line. Now fine $\vec{QP}$ and the direction vector of the line $L$ (call that $d$). Now the normal $\vec{n}= \vec{QP} \times d$. Then we can use the formula $A(x-x_0)+B(y-y_0)+C(z-z_0)=0$ to get the equation.
