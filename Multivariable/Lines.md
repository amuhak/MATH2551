If you have a line $L$ that passes through point $P_0$ and is parallel to the vector $\vec{v}$ the equation for the line is: 
$$
r(t) = r_0 + t \vec{v}
$$
Where $r$ is the position vector of the point $P$ that is on $L$ and $r_0$ is the position vector of $P_0$.

# Distance from a Point to a Line
The distance from a point $S$ to a line $L$ which passes through a point $P$ and is parallel to a vector $v$ is, 
$$
d = \dfrac{||\vec{PS} \times v||}{||v||}
$$
