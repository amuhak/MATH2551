# Lines
## Parallel
Compare direction vectors, if they are multiples of each other they are parallel. 
## Coincident 
If the lines a parallel and they share points they are coincident. (They are the same line)
## Skew 
2 lines that are not intersecting and also are not parallel. 
Distance between two skew lines:
$\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ are the direction vectors and $P$ and $S$ are points on the lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively.
$$\text{Length} = \vec{PS} \cdot \frac{\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2}{\|\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2\|}$$
## Intersecting
Equate the 2 lines, if you get a solution you have intersecting lines. 

# Planes
## Parallel
Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel.
## Intersecting
If two planes are not parallel, they will intersect in a line.
### Direction Vector of Intersection Line
The direction vector for the line of intersection is found by the cross product of the normal vectors from the two planes.
