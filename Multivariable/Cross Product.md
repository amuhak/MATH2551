The vector which is perpendicular to both vector $a$ and vector $b$, the sides of a  parallelogram is the cross product, is the cross product of $a$ and $b$ ($a \times b$)

$$
a \times b = ||a|| \ ||b|| \sin {\theta} \ n
$$
$\theta$ is the angle between $a$ and $b$, and $n$ is the **unit vector** perpendicular to the plane containing $a$ and $b$.
